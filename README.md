## Features
**Pipeline Design Pattern:** The project implements a pipeline design pattern commonly used in web frameworks to process requests through a series of middleware components.

**Base Controller:** A base controller is provided to encapsulate common functionality shared across multiple controllers. It serves as a foundation for creating new controllers with shared features.

**ThreadPool Usage:** The project efficiently utilizes the ThreadPool for handling concurrent requests, improving the overall performance of the web application.
